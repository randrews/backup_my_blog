How to install:

First, install the gems:

sudo gem install simple-rss
sudo gem install hpricot

Now build the data model:

rake db:migrate

And then it should run:

ruby script/server

Anatomy:

All the tests are in spec, which you can run with:

rake spec

(install RSpec first)

Everything is in the normal places, plus there's a wrapper class in lib/rss_pull.rb
