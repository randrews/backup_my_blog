How to install:

First, install the gems:

     sudo gem install simple-rss
     sudo gem install hpricot

We need to add a couple directories, too:

     mkdir public/finished-jobs
     mkdir log

Now build the data model:

     rake db:migrate

And then it should run:

     ruby script/server

Anatomy:

All the tests are in spec, which you can run with:

     rake spec

(install RSpec first)

Everything is in the normal places, plus there's a wrapper class in lib/rss_pull.rb
